# Hello!
*Thanks for taking the time to stop by*. This repo serves as a kind of ever-changing portfolio of projects I'm currently excited about; right now it contains the majority of source code for my iOS app **Dalilah**—a smart personal assistant for musicians, students, and other life-long learners. The app is written entirely in **Swift**, and includes a suite of unit and UI tests. As a solo developer, I find myself relying heavily on **Fastlane** to speed up my deployment process, so I've included my Fastfile here as well.

Due to Dalilah's commercial nature—and nearness to release—I've recently chosen to make the master repo private, but I believe I've left enough here to adequately illustrate my coding style and abilities. *So please—feel free to poke around the repo* (and the screenshots at the bottom of this README.) If you'd like to learn more about **Dalilah**, you can visit the [official page](https://cmillerco.com/dalilah) on my website. And if you're feeling really adventurous, you're welcome to join the beta test while you're there.

If your interest is piqued and you'd like to see more of my code, I recommend taking a look at [**Swift CoreRestore**](https://github.com/cmilr/swift-core-restore)—a library I've recently created for adding easy Core Data **backup and restore** functionality to iOS apps. CoreRestore is a work-in-progress, but I'm proud of its simple API, light-weight nature, and the fact that it solves a problem many Swift developers experience.

You might also be interested in [**Swift DateKit**](https://github.com/cmilr/swift-datekit), my library for easily mocking dates and times in Xcode unit and UI tests. Don't be fooled by its small size—**DateKit** is a compact, highly effective set of methods and classes for testing date-critical iOS apps.

Ok, ***I know you're busy***, so thanks again for stopping by—I appreciate your time and interest.
